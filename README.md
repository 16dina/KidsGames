# KidsGames
'KidsGames' website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my Professional Skills final project.

- This repository contains 2 games. 
- In the index.html file you will find my abc game. I kept it called index because it's the main part of my project since I made this simple game by myself, and I'm quite proud of it.
- The index.html is connected with random.js and styling.css.
- The game is based of knowing the order of alphabets, the game will give a random letter, and the player has to move between 5 options of letters (one of them is the next letter). Once they choose, they will get feedback.
- In the snake.html you will find the snake game which I found online but reshaped in a couple ways. The game is now not just a snake game, but a math one for kids. The player has to first solve the simple addition question and then eat the amount of apples of the answer. So for example, if the question is 1 + 1, they have to eat 2 apples. They finish by eating the blue apple, and then they will get a result.
- Both games are played using voice commands. The model is trained using Teachable Machine.
- For the abc game: "Next", "Back", and "Choose" commands are used.
- For the math game: "Up", "Right", "Down", and "Left" commands are used.
